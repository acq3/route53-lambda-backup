# route53-lambda-backup

An AWS Lambda function to automatically back up Route 53 DNS records to S3.

## Setup

This script can be run either as a scheduled AWS Lambda function or as a cron job. Simply upload the script to AWS Lambda, set the `s3_bucket_name` and `s3_bucket_region` environmental variables, set up an IAM role (with Route 53 and S3 write permissions), and set the schedule.

Alternatively, you can set the script to run using cron on an EC2 instance with the appropriate IAM role permissions. Don't forget to set the `s3_bucket_name` and `s3_bucket_region` variables in the file when doing so.

## Restoring Backups

Backups generated by this script are uploaded as csv files to the specified AWS S3 bucket. They can be restored using the route53-transfer module. The code and documentation for this module, including how to restore the Route 53 DNS records, can be found [here](https://github.com/RisingOak/route53-transfer).
